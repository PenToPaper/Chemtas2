                        As with many discoveries, the atom can be traced back to philosophical origin. The early Greek philosophers Leucippus and Democritus formed the basic atomic theory that would later prove to be the foundation of modern
                        understanding of the world. The two philosophers are considered to be the first “atomists.” “Atomism,” is defined as the theory that minute, discrete, finite, and indivisible elements are the ultimate constituents of all
                        matter. Basically, it's synonymous with atomic theory. Some dispute that atomism was present before Leucippus and Democritus, but this claim is not backed by much historical evidence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not much is known about Leucippus, except that he was Democritus’ teacher. One can, however, extrapolate what Leucippus believed from Democritus’ thoughts, as Democritus is said to have taken over, organized, and expanded on
                        his teacher’s theory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These early atomists believed that the natural world consists of two fundamental, individual bodies: “atoms,” and the “void.” They described atoms as the limit of physical division – that is, the smallest particles that exist.
                        The word “atom” itself was rooted in the Greek adjective “atomos,” which literally means “uncuttable.” Conversely, Leucippus and Democritus defined the void as the exact opposite of atoms – simply as nothingness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As they are the limit of division, atoms were thought to be inherently unchangeable. According to these early philosophers, different types of atoms could be distinguished through their shape, size, order, and position. They
                        would be in constant motion, and, depending on their shape, could temporarily bond with one another (but couldn’t permanently fuse) through the hooks and barbs on their surfaces. On a more macroscopic scale, they explained
                        that the differences in properties among tangible materials resulted from differences between atoms and the amount of “void” between them.
                    </p>
                    <p>Democritus applied his idea to other aspects of philosophy, like the origin of life, and the nature of truth.</p>
                    <p>
                        Atomic theory also presented a solution to several philosophical problems of the time. Very notably, Zeno of Elea suggested that, if measurements can be divided into infinity, it would be impossible for motion to occur.
                        Consider, for example, a runner that is trying to catch up to a tortoise in a race, where both are moving at a constant, linear speed. The runner, naturally, would be moving considerably faster than the tortoise. Yet, in the
                        time it takes for the runner to catch up to the tortoise’s original position, the tortoise will have moved forward some distance. The runner would then attempt to move that distance, but in the time it takes them to do that,
                        the tortoise has, once again, moved forward another distance. Theoretically, this process would repeat infinitely, and the runner would never catch up to the tortoise. Motion would be impossible unless there is a limit to
                        division. While some philosophers (namely Parmenides) responded to the paradox by considering motion itself to be an illusion, Democritus resolved it through his atomic theory.

                    <p>
                        The key points that Leucippus and Democritus held, in regards to the atomic model, were that atoms were indivisible, unchangeable physical existences. They were believed to vary among themselves in size, shape, order. In space
                        where atoms did not occupy, they explained, existed nothing: a “void.” The amount of void between atoms, as well as the physical properties of the atom, would, in turn, give macroscopic materials their properties.
                    </p>
                    <p>Although, as we can tell with a couple thousand years of hindsight, his atomic theory was not completely true, his ideas paved the way for the modern understanding of the atom.</p>

                        Modern atomic theory can now be traced back to John Dalton, an English chemist and schoolteacher that provided experimental evidence to Democritus’ claims. This occurred some 2000 years after Democritus, due in part to
                        Aristotle’s refuting of Democritus’ theory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Attempts to trace exactly how John Dalton developed his atomic theory, however, have proven futile. Even Dalton himself had incomplete recollections on the subject. We do know that Dalton completed several experiments that
                        provided evidence of the existence of atoms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For instance, Dalton developed the law of multiple proportions by expanding on the work of Antoine Lavoisier and Joseph Proust. Dalton realized that 100 grams of tin could combine with either 13.5 or 27 grams of oxygen to form
                        a tin oxide. The key here is that 27 grams is exactly double 13.5 grams. An atomic theory of matter could explain this occurrence, by showing that tin could either bind with some number of oxygen atoms (the 13.5g case), or
                        combine with exactly twice that number of oxygen atoms (the 27g case).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dalton had also investigated water's absorption of different gases. An atomic theory could explain why water absorbed different gases in different proportions. For example, Dalton observed that water would absorb carbon
                        dioxide far better than it would absorb nitrogen. He inferred that this was due to differences in mass and complexity of the two gases' particles.
                    </p>
                    <p>These key inferences, along with experimental evidence, led to his version of atomic theory, consisting of four main points:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Everything is comprised of tiny, indivisible particles called atoms.</li>
                        <li>Atoms of the same element are identical to each other, but are different from atoms of other elements.</li>
                        <li>Atoms of elements can be physically mixed together, or can be chemically combined in integer ratios to form compounds.</li>
                        <li>Chemical reactions can join, separate, or change the arrangement of an assortment of atoms. The atoms themselves retain their identity throughout this reaction.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Dalton's theory was quickly adopted by many scientists, and eventually became one of the most important theories in all of science.</p>

                    <p>
                        To accompany his set of theories, John Dalton proposed a model of the atom. He described atoms as solid, hard spheres that were, like Democritus had said, the smallest physical unit. Unlike Democritus’ model, however, Dalton’s
                        “billiard ball” model consisted of only spheres. Dalton also incorporated a more robust theory in regards to chemical reactions and physical mixtures of different substances.
